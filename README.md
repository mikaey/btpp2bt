# Braintree/PayPal 2-Button Test

This demo shows how you can render two separate PayPal buttons on a page, and to have separate code to handle each button.

## How to install

1. Create a `config.php` file with your Braintree credentials.  See `config.php.sample` for an example.
2. Run `composer install`.
3. Load the page in your browser.
